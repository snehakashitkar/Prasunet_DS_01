#Introduction
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Understanding the distribution of ages within a population is crucial for various analyses and decision-making processes. This project simplifies the process by providing a Python script to create a bar chart visualisation.

#Prerequisites
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Before using the code, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed: -Python 3.x -Pandas -Matplotlib

You can install the required Python libraries using pip: pip install pandas matplotlib

Getting Started
Data Preparation
Ensure you have the relevant population data in an Excel file (e.g., "2.1_Population_dynamics.xlsx") located in the same directory as your script.
The Excel file should contain a column with age data (e.g., 'Age').
Running the Script
Open a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Python script).
Copy and paste the provided code for creating a bar chart visualization into your Python environment.
3.Executing the Visualization

Run the script.
The code will load the data, process it, and create a bar chart representing the age distribution in the population dataset.
Usage
Use this project to:

Gain insights into the age distribution of a population.
Visualise age demographics for various analysis purposes.
Customization
You can customise the visualisation by making the following modifications to the code:

Replace 'Age' in df['Age'] with the actual column name containing age data in your dataset.
Adjust the appearance of the bar chart, such as labels, colours, and size, to suit your preferences.
Examples
Here's an example of how the age distribution bar chart might look:
